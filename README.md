Simple weapons slings for qbcore framework, xTxVxTx Edit


This is two scripts, one for mele weapons, and another for guns.
Ensure or Start both of them.

I changed the weapons locations to better fit with police vests and other outfits.
Plus the mele weapons are not directly overlaying on the guns.
Will put any weapons in a players inventory onto their back, so they will no longer be able to pull AK-47's out of thin air.
